# Get in Touch

I love connecting with people who are passionate about creating, building, and exploring. Whether you're working on something interesting, have a question, or just want to chat about consciousness and creativity, I'd love to hear from you.

## Ways to Connect

### Email
The best way to reach me is via email: **hello@ksrivats.io**

I try to respond within a day or two, though sometimes I take longer to craft thoughtful responses.

### Social Media

- **LinkedIn**: [linkedin.com/in/kaushiksrivatsan](https://linkedin.com/in/kaushiksrivatsan) - for professional connections
- **Twitter**: [@kaushiks](https://twitter.com/kaushiks) - for quick thoughts and conversations
- **GitHub**: [github.com/AmazingK2k3](https://github.com/AmazingK2k3) - for code and projects

## What I'd Love to Hear About

- **Your Projects**: Especially if they're at the intersection of technology and creativity
- **Collaborations**: Opportunities to work together on meaningful projects
- **Ideas**: Thoughts on AI, consciousness, creativity, or technology
- **Feedback**: On anything you've read or seen on this site
- **Questions**: About my work, background, or anything else

## Response Philosophy

I believe in thoughtful communication. I'd rather take time to give you a meaningful response than rush a quick reply. If you don't hear back immediately, don't worry - I'm probably thinking about what you've shared.

## Current Interests

Right now, I'm particularly excited about:

- **AI Ethics and Consciousness**: The philosophical implications of artificial intelligence
- **Creative Technology**: Using code and algorithms as artistic tools
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Designing technology that enhances human capability
- **Open Source**: Contributing to projects that benefit everyone

## Let's Build Something Together

If you're working on something that could benefit from my background in AI, creative technology, or interdisciplinary thinking, I'd love to explore how we might collaborate.

The best projects happen when different perspectives come together to solve interesting problems.
