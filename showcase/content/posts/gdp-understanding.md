# Do you know what GDP is?

A deep dive into economic indicators and what they really tell us about human progress and well-being. We explore the limitations of GDP as a measure of societal success and alternative metrics that better capture human flourishing.

## The GDP Paradigm

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has become the standard measure of economic success, but does it truly reflect human well-being? This metric, developed during wartime, measures economic activity but fails to capture many aspects of human flourishing.

## What GDP Misses

GDP doesn't account for:
- Environmental degradation
- Income inequality
- Quality of life
- Health outcomes
- Education levels
- Social cohesion

## Alternative Measures

Several alternative metrics offer a more holistic view of societal progress:

### Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)
The GPI adjusts GDP by accounting for environmental costs and social factors.

### Human Development Index (HDI)
The HDI combines life expectancy, education, and income measures.

### Gross National Happiness (GNH)
Bhutan's approach to measuring progress through happiness and well-being.

## The Future of Economic Measurement

As we advance into the 21st century, we need economic indicators that better reflect human progress. The goal should be sustainable development that enhances human well-being while protecting our planet.

Understanding these metrics helps us make better decisions about the kind of society we want to build.
