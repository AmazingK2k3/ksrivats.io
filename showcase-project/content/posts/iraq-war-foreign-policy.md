## Note

*This paper analyzes the Iraq War and its lasting impact on American foreign policy as part of my undergraduate research in International Relations at Sai University. Written to examine the complex factors that led to this pivotal moment in modern geopolitics and its ongoing consequences.*

## Introduction (Excerpts)

On the evening of March 19, 2003, President George W. Bush delivered a speech to the entire American population and, by extension, the world, signalling the start of the conflict that would irrevocably change the trajectory of U.S. international relations as well as the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. As the President declared that night, "The people of the United States and our friends and allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace with weapons of mass murder." Little did he know, perhaps, that the decisions made in the lead-up to the Iraq War and its turbulent aftermath would unleash a cascade of consequences, some intended and others unforeseen.

In the past 20 years, a large number of academics, researchers, and journalists have examined every aspect of the conflict and its justification. Al-Qaeda's role in the September 11 attacks and Washington, D.C.'s desperate search for a convenient scapegoat to underscore their continued global domination are two factors that come to mind right once. Although this may be somewhat true—and will be covered later—understanding the impetus for the Iraq war requires knowledge of American politics in the 1990s, when Iraq became a pressing US security issue coinciding with the rise of Neo-conservatism.
