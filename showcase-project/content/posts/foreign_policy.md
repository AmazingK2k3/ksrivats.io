## Executive Abstract

The United States stands at a critical juncture in global affairs, characterized by a shift in the geopolitical landscape with an increase in non-alignment and consistent questions being raised about its global supremacy. The following recommendations shall be considered for America to adapt and navigate in the new era of 2024 and beyond:

- **Prioritizing Economic revitalization and growth** by focusing on poverty and industrial trade policies
- **Fostering the growth of the American industry** shifting away from neoliberal principles
- **Increase in public investment** and shifting economic policies towards self-reliance and independence
- **Implement comprehensive immigration reforms** ensuring expansion of legal pathways for migrant influx with an enhanced focus on integration efforts for the migrants to bolster the future American workforce and stimulate industrial growth
- **Reasserting American leadership** by rebuilding the eroding trust of the US in the world, starting from our close allies in the European Union followed by the Global South
- **Reaffirming our commitment** to the international institutions and rule-based order and guiding American values
- **Ensure consistency in foreign policy** concerning humanitarian stance
- **Using leverage against Israel** to bring about temporary peace in the region while reemphasizing an increase in European defence autonomy to strengthen NATO and other alliances
- **Having a China strategy** to prevent its occupation of Taiwan by leveraging our alliances in the Indo-Pacific region
- **Embrace a policy of military restraint** after the disaster in Afghanistan and Iraq shifting our focus towards diplomatic resolutions rather than military interventions

These recommendations to the President emphasize the need for astute leadership in navigating the complex geopolitical shifts fostering cooperation and stability in international relations.
