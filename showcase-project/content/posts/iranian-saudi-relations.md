## Note

*This paper examines the complex relationship between Iran and Saudi Arabia as part of my coursework in Contemporary Crises in the MENA Region at Sai University. Written under the guidance of Prof Sherman and Jyotsna, this analysis explores how recent developments have fundamentally altered Middle Eastern dynamics.*

## Introduction 

In an address before a joint Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) summit in the presence of Lebanese and Iranian dignitaries on November 11, 2024, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salaman demanded that Israel immediately cease its military aggression in Gaza and Lebanon, describing it as a 'collective genocide'. This conference comes a year after a similar gathering in Riyadh, where leaders for the first time criticised Israeli conduct as 'barbaric'. This is also regarded as progress from the Iran-Saudi Arabia peace talks brokered by China in 2023.

This contrasts sharply with Saudi Arabia's silence on the Palestinian issue while negotiating a historic normalisation pact with Israel for US security benefits, as well as MBS's comparison of Iran's Supreme Leader to Adolf Hitler.

The events of the recent half-decade have fundamentally altered the relationship between Saudi Arabia, Iran, and their supporters. With Saudi Arabia as the Arab world's leader and Iran's strong influence in the Levant, this paper seeks to investigate the complicated relationship between the two nations, the historical context and factors involved, and what has changed in the past 5 years, shedding light on the ties defining Middle Eastern stability in the future, with an incoming Trump administration hawkish on Iran and the escalating nature of the Israel-Hamas-Hezbollah war.
