As a member of Gen Z who began undergraduate studies in the aftermath of the pandemic, I have been consistently drawn to understanding how institutions, systems, and the digital world intersect and influence one another. The complexity of global supply chains, macroeconomics, and geopolitical relationships particularly fascinates me, especially as they evolved alongside rapidly advancing technology. This curiosity naturally led me to pursue a degree in Computing & Data Science with a minor in International Relations—a combination that positions me to examine the critical intersection of institutions, policy, and technology during an era of unprecedented evolution of AI.

## Understanding AI as Economic Infrastructure

To understand AI's impact on modern society, we must first establish what constitutes AI from an economic perspective. Contemporary generative AI functions simultaneously as both a tool—comparable to traditional hardware instruments—and as a productive infrastructure that generates tangible commodities like electricity alongside intangible services in education, healthcare, and decision-making processes [1]. While AI can be technically understood as computing systems based on neural networks and transformer models, this marks the first time in recorded history where technological development pivots around fundamentally unpredictable "black boxes" whose advancement relies entirely on scale rather than interpretable mechanisms. It is quite exhaustive on the environment with its huge demand for compute, thereby for water, electricity and land [1]. In that aspect, AI is a giant material infrastructure of the modern era, with its supply chain (like chips) entirely entangled with geopolitical conflict.

As we attempt to deal with the strong technological competition between multibillion-dollar corporations and the entire stock market banking on this technology for growth and prosperity, what does it mean to construct such an AI infrastructure responsibly for integration into society? What does the existing institutional landscape look like, and how can it be changed to accommodate this rapid change?

## Designing Responsible AI Systems

In my opinion, designing responsible AI systems entails incorporating a variety of principles like as explainability, interpretability, transparency, safety, robustness, fairness, and, most crucially, awareness. It is crucial that the model comprehends the subtle cultural differences and intricate relationships between people worldwide. We should also have a clear understanding and transparency of not only how the model makes difficult decisions, but also the entire process of developing the model, its use cases in particular contexts, how the data is retrieved, any caveats, and more. A general-purpose LLM cannot be used to predict the outcome of a complex Indian judicial case since it continuously makes errors in determining how an Indian appears and lacks an understanding of security measures to handle sensitive data. As AI progresses from a frictionless digital technology domain to managing increasingly high-friction real-world scenarios with voice agents and, eventually, robotics, there are numerous potential concerns that must be addressed.

## AI as a Trust Engine in Institutional Transformation

From an infrastructure standpoint, AI serves as a trust engine (Verify Grok) in a world marked by high trust erosion in slow and complex traditional institutions. Every significant technology revolution throughout history necessitates institutional adaptation - labour laws, public educational systems, safety standards, and so on - but in this era of rapid AI adoption, we have seen far fewer efforts at institutional adaptation [2]. In the era of social media, public policy and geopolitical events can be transformed in an instant with a single tweet, disregarding the usual slow but important complex institutional process. Because of the algorithmic substitution of twentieth-century institutions, we are witnessing a situation in which attention is the primary commodity, narrative is the capital, and the only option for people to participate in the system is through speculation. Friction, in that aspect, without hindrance to technological innovation, might rather be the most valuable commodity in developing responsible AI and conceiving public policy regarding technology [3].

## Questions for the Future

At this critical juncture, old institutional frameworks may need to be completely redesigned to suit new technologies, but what does new institution-building look like in this new age? How will the world's geopolitical climate and power dynamics be more impacted (as they now are with chip wars and trade accords), and how will they adapt to change? How can a country like India, with its gigantic population, approach responsible AI penetration and the development of responsible infrastructure to accommodate its tremendous cultural and linguistic diversity? What concerns must be addressed in depth when developing Responsible AI? These are the kinds of questions I'm interested in exploring. This is an evolving blog, where as I come across more thoughts and articles, I will find my ways to add values and additional takes here.
