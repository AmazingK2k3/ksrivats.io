## Note

*This article is part of my undergraduate research in International Relations, exploring Russian influence in the Middle East and North Africa region. Written as part of my International Relations minor at Sai University, this paper examines Russia's strategic positioning in MENA amidst recent geopolitical developments including the fall of Assad's regime in Syria.*

## Introduction

Cries of excitement and delight rang out across the Middle East and around the world on December 8, 2024, as the Syrian people finally had a voice after decades of silence. The Assad regime fell amid a significant onslaught by opposition forces led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).1 Bashar al-Assad was tracked to flee in exile aboard a plane that was closely monitored by people all over the world, eventually landing in Moscow. As the world gradually rediscovers and examines what has just transpired, the atrocities of Assad coming to light once more, social media exploding with speeches and passionate celebrations, many political writers and thinkers went to the Kremlin. Is this the end of Kremlin influence in the Middle East? Russian telegram channels discussed resource waste, including the potential loss of Russia's only warm water port Tartous and airfield Khmeimim in the Mediterranean, as live imagery showed tanker jets transporting equipment from the sites.2

In his year-end Q&A session, Putin disputed the demise
of Assad and questioned Russia's aims, claiming that its missions and interests had already been met.3 However, the question is how Moscow became such a powerful player in the Middle East when, just over ten years before the 2010s, it had very little sway. Why is Russia even being discussed about MENA when, as of right now, the Kremlin appears to be a distant third in terms
of its influence in the region, with American hegemony still in place and China emerging as a major trading hub and political force in the region? In light of the unprecedented instability brought on by the war in Ukraine, the regional conflict between Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, and Iran, and most recently, the overthrow of Assad's regime, this paper aims to explore and comprehend Russia's grand strategy for MENA following the fall of the Soviet Union and how it
will influence the geopolitics of the region.
