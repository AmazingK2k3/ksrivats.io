## Project Overview

This project represents my journey of understanding deep learning concepts from the ground up by implementing neural networks and Large Language Models (LLMs) entirely from scratch. Rather than relying on high-level frameworks, this educational endeavor focuses on building everything from basic mathematical operations to complex transformer architectures using fundamental programming concepts as an educational initiative.
