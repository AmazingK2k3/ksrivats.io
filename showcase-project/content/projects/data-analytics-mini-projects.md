## Overview

This project is to just redirect to my repository that consists of all the data analysis related projects. Kindly check the github when you get time!

## Featured Projects

### 1. Threat Classification and Intrusion Detection System

**Dataset**: UNSW_NB15  
**Techniques**: Feature Engineering, Random Forest, Classification  
**Achievement**: Maximum accuracy of 0.9435 using Random Forest classifier

Performed comprehensive threat detection analysis on the UNSW_NB15 cybersecurity dataset, implementing feature engineering techniques to improve model performance and accurately classify different types of network threats.

### 2. Intrusion Detection Using Isolation Forest

**Dataset**: NetFlow Data  
**Techniques**: Isolation Forest, Random Forest, Anomaly Detection  

Developed an intrusion detection system using both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches, comparing the effectiveness of Isolation Forest for anomaly detection with Random Forest for classification tasks.

### 3. Network Traffic Classification

**Dataset**: NetFlow Data  
**Focus**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis on NetFlow data to understand the distribution and patterns of different network protocols, providing insights into network behavior and traffic characteristics.

### 4. Link Utilization Forecasting

**Dataset**: Link Statistics Data  
**Techniques**: ARIMA Models, Time Series Analysis  

Analyzed and forecasted incoming and outgoing network traffic patterns using ARIMA models, enabling predictive insights for network capacity planning and resource allocation.

### 5. Retail Data Analysis

**Dataset**: Retail Sales Data  
**Focus**: Investigative Analysis, Sales Patterns  

Performed comprehensive investigative analysis of retail dataset with emphasis on weekly sales features, identifying key insights about department performance and store type characteristics.
