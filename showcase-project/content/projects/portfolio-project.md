# Personal Portfolio Website

This portfolio website represents my journey in creating a modern, content-driven web presence that combines the best of static site generation with dynamic content management. Built with React and TypeScript, it leverages Vite for fast development and Node.js for backend functionality, all while utilizing Markdown for easy content creation and management. I will be writing my experience here soon on building this website and the planning behind it!! Until then find and explore my github repository for this work in progress!.
