# Digital Sketches Collection

This collection represents my journey into digital art, where I explore different themes, styles, and techniques. Each piece tells a story or captures a moment of inspiration.

## About This Collection

Digital sketching has become my creative outlet, allowing me to experiment with:

- **Character Studies**: Exploring expressions and emotions
- **Landscape Concepts**: Capturing scenes from imagination
- **Abstract Forms**: Playing with shapes and colors
- **Anime-Inspired Art**: Drawing from my love of animation

## Tools & Techniques

I primarily use:
- **iPad Pro** with Apple Pencil for mobility
- **Procreate** for digital painting
- **Adobe Photoshop** for detailed work
- **Traditional pencil and paper** for initial concepts

## Creative Process

My creative process usually starts with a simple idea or emotion I want to capture. I begin with rough sketches, gradually refining the composition, and then adding details and colors that enhance the mood I'm trying to convey.

Each piece is an experiment, and I'm constantly learning new techniques and pushing my artistic boundaries.
