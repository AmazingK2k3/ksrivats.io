# About Me

Hey there! I'm Kaushik Srivatsan, a curious mind exploring the intersection of technology, creativity, and human potential.

## What I Do

Currently, I'm working as an AI POC Research Intern at **Siemens**, where I get to dive deep into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence and its practical applications. My work involves exploring how AI can solve real-world problems while pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

## My Interests

I'm drawn to the big questions:

- **Consciousness and AI**: What does it mean to be aware? Can machines truly understand?
- **Creative Technology**: How can we use code and algorithms as tools for artistic expression?
- **Human-Centered Design**: Building technology that enhances rather than replaces human capability

## Philosophy

I believe in building things that matter. Not just because they can be built, but because they serve a purpose, solve a problem, or bring joy to people's lives. There's enough noise in the world - I want to create signal.

## Beyond Work

When I'm not coding or researching, you'll find me:

- **Reading**: Philosophy, science fiction, and anything that challenges my thinking
- **Creating**: Digital art, music, and experimental projects
- **Exploring**: Always curious about new places, ideas, and perspectives

## This Space

This digital garden is my attempt to share what I'm learning and thinking about. It's a place where ideas can grow, connect, and evolve. I believe in thinking out loud and inviting others into the conversation.

## Let's Connect

I love meeting people who are passionate about creating, building, and exploring. Whether you're working on something interesting, have a question, or just want to chat about consciousness and creativity, I'd love to hear from you.
